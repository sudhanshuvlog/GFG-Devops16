## Cloud Computing

### Private Cloud/Data Center Management

- In the traditional model, we have to buy the hardware and software and then we have to maintain them.
- Instead of buying the hardware, and software, and maintaining them, we can use the public cloud services.
- Also traditional model involves a lot of time and capital to set up the infrastructure like cooling, power, workers to monitor the infrastructure, etc.

### Cloud Computing Overview

- Utilize cloud services instead of owning and maintaining hardware and software.
- AWS, Azure, GCP, etc., offer diverse cloud services.
- Leverage cloud provider services to create and deploy applications without managing underlying hardware and software.
- Eliminate concerns about hardware/software maintenance, focusing on deploying and scaling applications.

### AWS

- AWS stands for Amazon Web Services, They provide cloud services for infrastructure, storage, databases, and more.

### AWS Global Infrastructure

- AWS has multiple data centers in different regions across the world.
- AWS Global Infrastructure consists of the following components:
    - **Region**
    - **Availability Zone**
    - **Edge Location**
- Each region has multiple availability zones.
- Each availability zone has one or more data centers.
- Each data center has redundant power, networking, and connectivity.
- Edge locations are used to cache the content and to reduce the latency.

### AWS IAM

- AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources.
- It allows you to manage users and their level of access to the AWS Console.
- It is used to manage the users, groups, roles, and policies.
