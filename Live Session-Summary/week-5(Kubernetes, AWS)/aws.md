## Cloud Computing

### Traditional Model

- In traditional model, we have to buy the hardware and software and we have to maintain them.
- Instead of buying the hardware, software, and maintaining them, we can use the cloud services.
- Also traditional model involves a lot of time and money to set up the infrastructure like cooling, power, workers to monitor the infrastructure, etc.

### What is Cloud Computing?

- We can use cloud services instead of buying the hardware, software, and maintaining them.
- In market there are many cloud providers like AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.
- We can use the cloud providers services to create the infrastructure and we can use the infrastructure to deploy the applications.
- So, We don't have to worry about the hardware, software, and maintaining them.

### AWS

- AWS stands for Amazon Web Services, They provide cloud services to manage our infrastructure, storage, databases, etc.

### AWS Global Infrastructure

- AWS has data centers in different regions across the world.
- AWS Global Infrastructure consists of the following components:
    - **Region**
    - **Availability Zone**
    - **Edge Location**
- Each region has multiple availability zones.
- Each availability zone has one or more data centers.
- Each data center has redundant power, networking, and connectivity.
- Edge locations are used to cache the content and to reduce the latency.
