- **Master Node**
    - The master node is responsible for managing the Kubernetes cluster.
    - The master node consists of the following components:
        - **API Server**
            - The API server is responsible for serving the Kubernetes API.
            - It is used for communication between the master node and the worker nodes, users, and external clients.
        - **Scheduler**
            - The scheduler is responsible for scheduling the applications on the worker nodes.
            - It is responsible for placing the pods on the nodes.
        - **Controller Manager**
            - The controller manager is responsible for managing the controllers.
            - It is responsible for managing the replication controller, endpoints controller, namespace controller, and service accounts controller.
        - **etcd**
            - etcd is a distributed key-value DB used to store the cluster state.
            - It is used by the master node to store the cluster state.

- **Worker Node**

    - The worker node is responsible for running the applications.
    - It consists of the following components:
        - **Kubelet**
            - The kubelet is used to communicate with the master node, It will get all the information from the master node and it will run the containers.
            - It is responsible for managing the containers on the worker node.
        - **Kube Proxy**
            - The kube proxy is responsible for managing the network on the worker node.
            - It is responsible for routing the traffic to the containers.
        - **Container Runtime**
            - The container runtime is responsible for running the containers.
            - It is responsible for managing the containers on the worker node.
