- *Jenkinsfile* - A Jenkinsfile is a text file that contains the definition of a Jenkins Pipeline. It is written using the Groovy DSL (Domain-Specific Language) and is used to define the entire build process, including stages, steps, and other configurations. This approach provides consistency, repeatability, and easy collaboration in the software development and deployment process. A sample pipeline with name `jenkinsfile` is present in this repo.
- Check more about the pipeline functionality and syntax here - [https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/]
- Configure the SonarQube Server using the `SonarQube-docker-compose.yml` file present in this Repo
