#yum install openssh-server -y

Make PermitRootLogin yes and PasswordAuthentication yes
#vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config 

Generate host keys
#ssh-keygen -A 

start server
#/usr/sbin/sshd 

Set the root password or password for any other user
#passwd root

Come out from the container, find it's ip addr with #hostname -I let's say IP is 172.17.0.3
#ssh root@172.17.0.3

You would be able to login! Cool!
